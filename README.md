## Neurocomputational mechanisms underlying motivated seeing 
The online supplement for our paper <i> Neurocomputational mechanisms underlying motivated seeing </i> is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/ycleong/MotivatedPerception](https://github.com/ycleong/MotivatedPerception). In service of other researchers who would like to reproduce our work or are interested in applying the same models in their own work, we have made our data and code available. If you have any questions, or find any bugs (or broken links), please email me at ycleong@stanford.edu.
